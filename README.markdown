# iFrontRow #

Pre Release Version: v0.0.1, Last updated: 12/Nov/2011

Apple Â© has discontinued the Front Row application in Lion (OS X 10.7.x). However for me and all those
who liked the application and used to view trailers I thought of resurrecting it as iFrontRow.
The intension is not to re-engineer the whole application but only to resurrect part which makes sense
(i.e. are can exist individually). The interface is web driven and currently runs well on Apple Safari.
As time permits I would try to make it more platform portable.
