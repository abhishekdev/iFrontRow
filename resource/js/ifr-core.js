With the invincible Bow, the king will be able to overthrow the Gods of Olympus and become the undisputed master of his world. With ruthless efficiency, Hyperion and his legions destroy everything in their wake, and it seems nothing will stop the evil king’s mission. As village after village is obliterated, a stonemason named Theseus (Henry Cavill) vows to avenge the death of his mother in one of Hyperion’s raids. When Theseus meets the Sybelline Oracle, Phaedra (Freida Pinto), her disturbing visions of the young man’s future convince her that he is the key to stopping the destruction. With her help, Theseus assembles a small band of followers and embraces his destiny in a final desperate battle for the future of humanity."},"cast":{"name":["Henry Cavill","Stephen Dorff","Isabel Lucas","Freida Pinto","Luke Evans","Kellan Lutz","John Hurt","Mickey Rourke"]},"genre":{"name":"Action and Adventure"},"poster":{"location":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/immortals/images/poster.jpg","xlarge":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/immortals/images/poster-xlarge.jpg"},"preview":{"large":{"filesize":"38518575","content":"http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/immortals/immortals-tlr3_h480p.mov"}}},{"id":"4603","info":{"title":"Into the Abyss","runtime":"2:25","rating":"PG-13","studio":"IFC Films","postdate":"2011-10-26","releasedate":"2011-11-11","copyright":"© Copyright 2011 IFC Films","director":"Werner Herzog","description":"Legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog (CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS, GRIZZLY MAN) returns with INTO THE ABYSS: A TALE OF DEATH, A TALE OF LIFE, a riveting examination of a horrible crime which probes the human psyche to explore why people kill—and why the state kills.

As head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for nearly 50 years, he would stop at nothing to protect his country.  Through eight presidents and three wars, Hoover waged battle against threats both real and perceived, often bending the rules to keep his countrymen safe.  His methods were at once ruthless and heroic, with the admiration of the world his most coveted, if ever elusive, prize. Hoover was a man who placed great value on secrets—particularly those of others—and was not afraid to use that information to exert authority over the leading figures in the nation.  Understanding that knowledge is power and fear poses opportunity, he used both to gain unprecedented influence and to build a reputation that was both formidable and untouchable. He was as guarded in his private life as he was in his public one, allowing only a small and protective inner circle into his confidence.  His closest colleague, Clyde Tolson, was also his constant companion.  His secretary, Helen Gandy, who was perhaps most privy to Hoover’s designs, remained loyal to the end…and beyond.  Only Hoover’s mother, who served as his inspiration and his conscience, would leave him, her passing truly crushing to the son who forever sought her love and approval. As seen through the eyes of Hoover himself, “J. Edgar” explores the personal and public life and relationships of a man who could distort the truth as easily as he upheld it during a life devoted to his own idea of justice, often swayed by the darker side of power.

But for Sam, it is not enough to shelter the LRA’s intended victims. Determined to save as many as possible, he leads armed missions deep into enemy territory to retrieve kidnapped children, restoring peace to their lives—and eventually his own.

In the wake of his mother’s sudden death, Norman must now also deal with the reality that his father is starting to lose his battle with stomach cancer. Norman, depressed and angry, unintentionally gets caught in a lie that he, in fact, has stomach cancer. Soon his complete distortion of the facts spirals out of control. Part coping mechanism, partially as a way to feel closer to his father, and to a certain degree to prepare others for his possible suicide, Norman begins to imitate his father’s debilitating physical symptoms, dramatically affecting his life and the world around him. Emily, a magnetic girl with one of those rare enchanting smiles, gets caught up in Norman’s fabrication and struggles with her deep rooted romantic feelings in the face of Norman’s “impending” death.

Desperate for some fast cash, Stephanie turns to her last resort: convincing her sleazy cousin to give her a job at his bail bonding company…as a recovery agent.  True, she doesn’t even own a pair of handcuffs and her weapon of choice is pepper spray, but that doesn’t stop Stephanie from taking on Vinny’s biggest bail-jumper: former vice cop and murder suspect Joe Morelli - yup, the same sexy, irresistible Joe Morelli who seduced and dumped her back in high school.

Paul Danziger (co-director Mark Kassen), his longtime friend and partner, is the straightlaced and responsible yin to Mike’s yang. Their mom-and-pop personal-injury law firm is getting by, but things really get interesting when they decide to take on a case involving Vicky (Vinessa Shaw), a local ER nurse, who is pricked by a contaminated needle on the job. As Weiss and Danziger dig deeper into the case, a health care and pharmaceutical conspiracy teeters on exposure and heavyweight attorneys move in on the defense.

There is a new criminal mastermind at large—Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris)—and not only is he Holmes’ intellectual equal, but his capacity for evil, coupled with a complete lack of conscience, may actually give him an advantage over the renowned detective. When the Crown Prince of Austria is found dead, the evidence, as construed by Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), points to suicide. But Sherlock Holmes deduces that the prince has been the victim of murder—a murder that is only one piece of a larger and much more portentous puzzle, designed by one Professor Moriarty. Mixing business with pleasure, Holmes tracks the clues to an underground gentlemen’s club, where he and his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) are toasting Dr. Watson on his last night of bachelorhood. It is there that Holmes encounters Sim (Noomi Rapace), a Gypsy fortune teller, who sees more than she is telling and whose unwitting involvement in the prince’s murder makes her the killer’s next target. Holmes barely manages to save her life and, in return, she reluctantly agrees to help him. The investigation becomes ever more dangerous as it leads Holmes, Watson and Sim across the continent, from England to France to Germany and finally to Switzerland. But the cunning Moriarty is always one step ahead as he spins a web of death and destruction—all part of a greater plan that, if he succeeds, will change the course of history. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie returns to direct “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,” the follow-up to the smash hit “Sherlock Holmes.” The sequel also reunites producers Joel Silver, Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey and Dan Lin. Bruce Berman serves as executive producer, with Steve Clark-Hall co-producing. Jared Harris (TV’s “Mad Men,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”) joins the cast as the notorious Professor Moriarty. Also joining the cast, in her first English-speaking role, is Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, who gained international attention in the Swedish film “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.” Stephen Fry (“Alice in Wonderland,” “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire”) plays Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s older brother. Additional cast members returning from the first film include Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade; Kelly Reilly as Watson’s bride, Mary Morstan; and Geraldine James as Holmes’s long-suffering landlady, Mrs. Hudson. “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” is written by Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were created by the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and appear in stories and novels by him."},"cast":{"name":["Robert Downey Jr.","Jude Law","Noomi Rapace","Jared Harris","Eddie Marsan","Stephen Fry","Gilles Lellouche"]},"genre":{"name":["Action and Adventure","Thriller"]},"poster":{"location":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/sherlockholmesagameofshadows/images/poster.jpg","xlarge":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/sherlockholmesagameofshadows/images/poster-xlarge.jpg"},"preview":{"large":{"filesize":"46530651","content":"http://trailers.apple.com/movies/wb/sherlockholmes2/sherlockholmes-tlr2_h480p.mov"}}},{"id":"4340","info":{"title":"Take Shelter","runtime":"2:02","rating":"R","studio":"Sony Pictures Classics","postdate":"2011-05-24","releasedate":"2011-09-30","copyright":"© Copyright 2011 Sony Pictures Classics","director":"Jeff Nichols","description":"Plagued by a series of apocalyptic visions, a young husband and father questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself."},"cast":{"name":["Michael Shannon","Jessica Chastain","Shea Whigham","Katy Mixon","Kathy Baker"]},"genre":{"name":"Drama"},"poster":{"location":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/sony/takeshelter/images/poster.jpg","xlarge":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/sony/takeshelter/images/poster-xlarge.jpg"},"preview":{"large":{"filesize":"36674251","content":"http://trailers.apple.com/movies/sony/takeshelter/takeshelter-tlr1_h480p.mov"}}},{"id":"4499","info":{"title":"Texas Killing Fields","runtime":"2:09","rating":"R","studio":"Anchor Bay Films","postdate":"2011-08-29","releasedate":"2011-10-14","copyright":"© Copyright 2011 Anchor Bay Films","director":"Ami Canaan Mann","description":"Inspired by true events, this tense and haunting thriller follows Detective Souder (Sam Worthington), a homicide detective in a small Texan town, and his partner, transplanted New York City cop DetectiveHeigh (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) as they track a sadistic serial killer dumping his victims’ mutilated bodies in a nearby marsh locals call “The Killing Fields.” Though the swampland crime scenes are outside their jurisdiction, Detective Heigh is unable to turn his back on solving the gruesome murders.

At the peak of his career, he was acknowledged to be the greatest singer-songwriter in American history.   But after a meteoric rise to record and radio super-stardom in the late 1940’s, the man had made a train wreck of his life. Drugs, alcohol, and a hair-trigger temper had ended two marriages, ruined a host of friendships and made the tortured genius a virtual untouchable in the music business. So at the end of 1952, Hank Williams gathered what was left of his physical strength to make things right, and begin the long road back. He booked New Years shows in West Virginia and Ohio, and hired a local kid who didn’t even own a radio, much less know who this legend was, to drive him there from Montgomery Alabama. Inspired by the mysterious final days Hank Williams’ mercurial life, THE LAST RIDE is the story of that final drive through the bleak Appalachian countryside of 1950’s America.

Directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin), the film also stars Alice Eve (Sex and the City 2), Brendan Gleeson (In Bruges) and Oliver Jackson-Cohen (Faster). When a mother and daughter are found brutally murdered in 19th century Baltimore, Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) makes a startling discovery: the crime resembles a fictional murder described in gory detail in the local newspaper—part of a collection of stories penned by struggling writer and social pariah Edgar Allan Poe. But even as Poe is questioned by police, another grisly murder occurs, also inspired by a popular Poe story. Realizing a serial killer is on the loose using Poe’s writings as the backdrop for his bloody rampage, Fields enlists the author’s help in stopping the attacks. But when it appears someone close to Poe may become the murderer’s next victim, the stakes become even higher and the inventor of the detective story calls on his own powers of deduction to try to solve the case before it’s too late.

Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago. But it is about to wake up. When a simple experiment frees the alien from its frozen prison, Kate must join the crew’s pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to keep it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish.

The thriller is directed by Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In). The screenplay adaptation is by the writing team of Bridget O’Connor & Peter Straughan.  The time is 1973. The Cold War of the mid-20th Century continues to damage international relations. Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a.k.a. MI6 and code-named the Circus, is striving to keep pace with other countries’ espionage efforts and to keep the U.K. secure. The head of the Circus, known as Control (John Hurt), personally sends dedicated operative Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) into Hungary. But Jim’s mission goes bloodily awry, and Control is forced out of the Circus - as is his top lieutenant, George Smiley (Gary Oldman), a career spy with razor-sharp senses.  Estranged from his absent wife Ann, Smiley is soon called in to see undersecretary Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney); he is to be rehired in secret at the government’s behest, as there is a gnawing fear that the Circus has long been compromised by a double agent, or mole, working for the Soviets and jeopardizing England. Supported by younger agent Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley parses Circus activities past and present. In trying to track and identify the mole, Smiley is haunted by his decades-earlier interaction with the shadowy Russian spy master Karla.  The mole’s trail remains cold until maverick field agent Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) unexpectedly contacts Lacon. While undercover in Turkey, Ricki has fallen for a betrayed married woman, Irina (Svetlana Khodchenkova), who claims to possess crucial intelligence. Separately, Smiley learns that Control narrowed down the list of mole suspects to five men. They are the ambitious Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), whom he had code-named Tinker; suavely confident Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), dubbed Tailor; stalwart Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds), called Soldier; officious Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), dubbed Poor Man; and - Smiley himself.  Even before the startling truth is revealed, the emotional and physical tolls on the players enmeshed in the deadly international spy game will escalate…  "},"cast":{"name":["Gary Oldman","Colin Firth","Tom Hardy","Mark Strong","Benedict Cumberbatch","Toby Jones","David Dencik","Svetlana Khodchenkova","Stephen Graham","Kathy Burke","Ciarán Hinds"]},"genre":{"name":"Thriller"},"poster":{"location":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/tinkertailorsoldierspy/images/poster.jpg","xlarge":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/focus_features/tinkertailorsoldierspy/images/poster-xlarge.jpg"},"preview":{"large":{"filesize":"36273590","content":"http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/tinkertailorsoldierspy/tinkertailorsoldierspy-tlr1_h480p.mov"}}},{"id":"4471","info":{"title":"Tower Heist","runtime":"2:01","rating":"PG-13","studio":"Universal Pictures","postdate":"2011-10-06","releasedate":"2011-11-04","copyright":"© Copyright 2011 Universal Pictures","director":"Brett Ratner","description":"Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy lead an all-star cast in Tower Heist, a comedy caper about working stiffs who seek revenge on the Wall Street swindler who stiffed them.

TUCKER AND DALE VS EVIL has been a hit on the festival circuit, debuting at Sundance, and winning the Midnight Audience Award at SXSW, the Jury Prize for First Feature at Fantasia, the Best Director award at Fantaspoa, and the Best Motion Picture Award at Sitges."},"cast":{"name":["Alan Tudyk","Tyler Labine","Katrina Bowden"]},"genre":{"name":["Comedy","Horror"]},"poster":{"location":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/tuckeranddalevsevil/images/poster.jpg","xlarge":"http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/tuckeranddalevsevil/images/poster-xlarge.jpg"},"preview":{"large":{"filesize":"48878414","content":"http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/tuckeranddalevsevil/tuckeranddalevsevil-tlr1_h480p.mov"}}},{"id":"4313","info":{"title":"War Horse","runtime":"2:32","rating":"PG-13","studio":"DreamWorks","postdate":"2011-10-04","releasedate":"2011-12-25","copyright":"© Copyright 2011 DreamWorks","director":"Steven Spielberg","description":"DreamWorks Pictures’ “War Horse,” director Steven Spielberg’s epic adventure, is a tale of loyalty, hope and tenacity set against a sweeping canvas of rural England and Europe during the First World War. “War Horse” begins with the remarkable friendship between a horse named Joey and a young man called Albert, who tames and trains him. When they are forcefully parted, the film follows the extraordinary journey of the horse as he moves through the war, changing and inspiring the lives of all those he meets—British cavalry, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter—before the story reaches its emotional climax in the heart of No Man’s Land. The First World War is experienced through the journey of this horse—an odyssey of joy and sorrow, passionate friendship and high adventure. “War Horse” is one of the great stories of friendship and war— a successful book, it was turned into a hugely successful international theatrical hit that is arriving on Broadway next year. It now comes to screen in an epic adaptation by one of the great directors in film history.

Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN explores nature vs. nurture on a whole new level as Eva’s own culpability is measured against Kevin’s innate evilness.
